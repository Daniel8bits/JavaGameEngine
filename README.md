# JavaGameEngine

It's a java game engine project from university. It's uncomplete but works.
The project is divided in two parts:

 - engine: which has all the engine classes itself
 - sample game: which was used as OOP work project and now as a sample of that engine
 
That project also appears in the LonelehKitten GitHub repository that is my personal repository.

The engine was made on IntelliJ IDEA.
